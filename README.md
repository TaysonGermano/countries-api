## My process

First I made sure I understood all the requirements for the web app and after that, I analyze the project to see what would be the best tools to use to devolop it.
Since I had the design files it was a bit easier to decide what technology would be best for the project. I underline I step by step process where I discussed how I would go about soliving the problems, what components need to be created, what dependencies I would use and last but not least, is the project big enogh to use a css library or not.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React-Router
- UUID

### What I learned

I learned a lot about APIs and how to make an API request using useEffect or ComponentDidMount and also this was one of the few project where I had to use Optional Chaining (?) to check the existence of an object key inside the API response
