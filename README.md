## My process

First I made sure I understood all the requirements for the web app and after that, I analyzed the project to see what would be the best tools to use to develop it.
Since I had the design files it was a bit easier to decide what technology would be best for the project. I underlined a step-by-step process where I discussed how I would go about solving the problems, what components needed to be created, what dependencies I would use, and last but not least, is the project big enough to use a CSS library or not.

### Built with

- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React-Router
- UUID
